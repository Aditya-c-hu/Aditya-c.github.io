       <h3>Efficient Management of Medical Resources</h3>
        <p>Data structures and algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing healthcare delivery and resource allocation in Aryavarta's medical facilities. Here's how:</p>

        <h4>Hash Tables for Patient Data Management</h4>
        <p><strong>Hash Tables</strong> provide an efficient way to manage patient data. With a hash table, patient records can be stored with a unique identifier (such as patient ID) as the key, allowing quick access to their medical history, appointment status, and other relevant information. Hash tables provide fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, ensuring that healthcare providers can quickly retrieve patient details and make informed decisions.</p>

        <h4>Heap Sort for Efficient Resource Prioritization</h4>
        <p><strong>Heap Sort</strong> can be used to prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions. A max-heap structure can help ensure that the most critical patients are treated first. It optimizes healthcare resources by reducing wait times and improving the overall flow of patients through medical facilities.</p>

        <h4>KMP Algorithm for Gene Sequence Search</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm</strong> can be applied in medical facilities to efficiently search for gene sequences in genomic data. For example, KMP can help quickly identify specific patterns or mutations in patient genetic information, aiding in faster diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. By optimizing the search for specific sequences, KMP ensures a quicker response in cases requiring genetic analysis.</p>
