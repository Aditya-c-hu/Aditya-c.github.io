    <h1>Water Pipeline Systems</h1>

    <section>
          <p>Addition of all houses in city with number of pipelines they have flowing into them with their repective coordinates.</p>
        <h2>Sorting Pipelines Based on Cost</h2>
        <p>To display the houses based on their cost from the supply point to find out the least and highest.</p>
        <h2>Using Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for optimal pump placement for most efficiency: </h2>
        <p>Floyd-Warshall helps identify the longest shortest path (i.e., the path that takes the longest time for water to reach). Placing a pump near nodes on this path reduces travel time and avoids water pressure drops. By placing pumps at optimal locations, the total pipeline length, operational costs, and energy usage are minimized. The algorithm helps find paths that reduce overall water transportation costs. </p>
        <h2>Shortest path During Maintainance:</h2>
        <p>Dijkstra’s algorithm is ideal for finding the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in a graph. This makes it useful for determining the optimal route to divert water flow during pipeline maintenance.The algorithm can adapt to real-time changes in the network, ensuring uninterrupted water supply.</p>
        <h2>Spanning tree of Water flow :</h2>
        <p>Kruskal’s algorithm is useful for designing and optimizing water pipeline networks by constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). This ensures that all junctions in the pipeline system are connected with the minimum total cost or least pipe length.Easily adapts to new pipeline connections or expansion projects.</p>
        <h2>Registering complaints by Searching for HouseID:</h2>
        <p> It uses information from previous comparisons to skip unnecessary checks, unlike naive pattern matching.Useful for searching house IDs in databases during real-time complaint registrations.House ID can be searched using just part of it.</p>
