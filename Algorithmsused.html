    <h1>Algorithms Used in the Code</h1>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative weights.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(V + E log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(V³) where V is the number of vertices.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected graph.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(E log E) where E is the number of edges.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Quick Sort</h2>
        <p>Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Average Efficiency:</strong> O(n log n) where n is the number of elements.</p>
        <p><strong>Worst-case Efficiency:</strong> O(n²) when the pivot selection is poor.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The KMP algorithm is used for substring search within a main string.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(n + m) where n is the length of the main string and m is the length of the pattern.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Rabin-Karp Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The Rabin-Karp algorithm is used for searching multiple patterns within a main string using hashing.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(n + m) on average and O(nm) in the worst case where n is the length of the main string and m is the length of the pattern.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Heap Sort</h2>
        <p>Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(n log n) where n is the number of elements.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Min Heap</h2>
        <p>A Min Heap is a binary tree where the parent node is less than or equal to its children, used to efficiently retrieve the minimum element.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(1) for getting the minimum element, O(log n) for insertions and deletions where n is the number of elements.</p>
